# Roadtrip planner
This repository I use for planning roadtrips. It creates a map with a set of markers (supplied by the user).

# Dependencies

- [Folium](https://github.com/python-visualization/folium): Python interface for creating a Leaflet.js map.
- [Geopy](https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): Python client for gathering coordinates of locations.

# Usage

The markers for the map are defined in a JSON file. 

# Examples
